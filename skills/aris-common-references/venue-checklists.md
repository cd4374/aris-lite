# Venue Checklists for ICLR, NeurIPS, ICML, IEEE, and APS PR Family

Use this reference near the end of `aris-4-1-paper-plan` and during the final checks in `aris-4-4-paper-write`.

## When to Read

- Read once when setting the target venue.
- Read again before locking the outline.
- Read again during final submission-readiness checks.

## Universal Requirements

Across these venues, the following are usually expected:

- enough experimental detail for reproduction,
- honest limitations and scope boundaries,
- clear mapping from claims to evidence,
- venue-appropriate page budgeting (ML main-body caps vs IEEE/APS journal-style expectations),
- strong claim-to-evidence closure and reproducibility transparency before declaring ready-to-submit.

## NeurIPS

Planning implications:

- The paper checklist is mandatory.
- Claims in the Abstract and Introduction must align with the actual evidence.
- The paper should discuss limitations honestly.
- Reproducibility details, hyperparameters, data access, and compute usage should be documented.
- Statistical reporting should specify error bars, number of runs, and how uncertainty is computed.

Final-check implications:

- Confirm the paper checklist is complete.
- Ensure limitations, reproducibility details, and compute reporting exist somewhere appropriate.
- Verify theory papers include assumptions and full proofs in the main paper or appendix.

## ICML

Planning implications:

- The paper must budget space for an ICML-style Broader Impact statement.
- Reproducibility expectations are strong: data splits, hyperparameters, search ranges, and compute should be documented.
- Statistical reporting should state whether uncertainty uses standard deviation, standard error, or confidence intervals.

Final-check implications:

- Ensure the Broader Impact statement is present in the expected location.
- Confirm anonymization is strict: no author names, acknowledgments, grant IDs, or self-identifying repository links.
- Verify experimental details are detailed enough for replication.

## ICLR

Planning implications:

- Reproducibility and ethics statements are often recommended even if not always mandatory.
- If LLMs materially contributed to ideation or writing to the point of authorship-like contribution, plan a disclosure section or appendix note.
- Keep the story front-loaded because ICLR reviewers often judge quickly from the early pages.

Final-check implications:

- Decide whether LLM disclosure is required for this project.
- Confirm the paper includes enough reproducibility guidance, code/data availability information, and limitations discussion.
- Check that the contribution is already clear by the end of the Introduction.

## IEEE Journal (Transactions / Letters)

Planning implications:

- IEEE journals are typically **not anonymous** — include full author names, affiliations, and IEEE membership status from submission.
- Use `\documentclass[journal]{IEEEtran}` with `\cite{}` (numeric citations via `cite` package). Do NOT use `natbib`.
- References **count toward the page limit**. IEEE Transactions typically allow 12-14 pages total; IEEE Letters (e.g., WCL, CL, SPL) typically allow 4-5 pages total. Check the specific journal's author guidelines.
- Include an `\begin{IEEEkeywords}` block immediately after the abstract.
- The bibliography style must be `IEEEtran.bst` (produces numeric `[1]` style citations).
- IEEE journals may require a biosketch (`\begin{IEEEbiography}`) for each author in the camera-ready version.
- Some IEEE journals require a cover letter addressing how the paper differs from conference versions (if applicable).

Final-check implications:

- Confirm author names and IEEE membership grades are correct (Member, Senior Member, Fellow).
- Verify the total page count including references is within the journal's limit.
- Check that all figures meet IEEE quality requirements: 300 dpi minimum, proper axis labels, readable when printed in grayscale.
- Ensure the paper uses two-column IEEE format throughout (the `[journal]` option handles this).
- Verify no `\citep` or `\citet` commands are present — IEEE uses `\cite{}` only.
- Check that `\bibliographystyle{IEEEtran}` is used.

## IEEE Conference (ICC, GLOBECOM, INFOCOM, ICASSP, etc.)

Planning implications:

- Most IEEE conferences are **not anonymous** (except some like IEEE S&P). Include full author information.
- Use `\documentclass[conference]{IEEEtran}` with `\cite{}` (numeric citations).
- References **count toward the page limit**. Typical limit: 5-6 pages (e.g., ICC, GLOBECOM), some allow up to 8 pages (e.g., INFOCOM). Extra pages may incur additional charges.
- Include `\begin{IEEEkeywords}` after the abstract.
- Conference papers do NOT include author biographies.
- Some IEEE conferences accept 2-page extended abstracts — confirm the paper category before planning.

Final-check implications:

- Verify total page count including references fits within the conference limit.
- Check that figures are readable at the two-column conference format size.
- Ensure `\bibliographystyle{IEEEtran}` is used.
- Verify no `\citep` or `\citet` commands are present.
- Confirm the correct `\documentclass` option (`[conference]`, not `[journal]`).
- Some conferences require IEEE copyright notice — check submission portal for specific requirements.

## APS PR Family (PRL / PRA / PRB / PRE / PRX)

Planning implications:

- APS journals are typically non-anonymous at submission; set author block accordingly.
- Use REVTeX (`revtex4-2`) templates and keep citation style consistent (`\\cite{}` numeric style).
- Keep claims conservative and tightly mapped to evidence; PR venues penalize overclaiming heavily.
- Reproducibility details should include exact commands, config provenance, and artifact IDs.

Final-check implications:

- Confirm venue-template alignment: PRL uses PRL template, PRX uses PRX template, PRA/PRB/PRE use corresponding family template.
- Verify no natbib-only citation commands are mixed into APS drafts.
- Ensure strongest-safe-claim consistency across abstract/introduction/conclusion and claims artifacts.
- Ensure reproducibility/authenticity artifact (`07_REPRODUCIBILITY_AND_AUTHENTICITY.md`) is complete.

## Minimal Submission Checklist

Before submission, verify:

- the venue-specific required sections are present,
- the page budget is satisfied for the main body,
- the contribution bullets do not overclaim,
- citations, figures, tables, and references are internally consistent,
- the package is quality-ready: strongest claims are evidence-backed, reproducibility details are complete, and major review issues are closed.
